### ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS CDK

AWS CDK is recommended to deploy on the cloud. Following is an overview of the infrastructure:

![Diagram](.github/aws/diagram.png)

Install the following dependencies:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)
    - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

For Docker, make sure that the deployment user is part of the `docker` group:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker YOUR_USERNAME
```

It is strongly recommended to make a [private fork](https://gist.github.com/0xjac/85097472043b697ab57ba1b1c7530274) of this repository. Make a branch `YOUR_ORG` and copy `apps/cdk/lib/cdk-stack.ts` to `apps/cdk/lib/YOUR_ORG-stack.ts` and update `apps/cdk/bin/cdk.ts` to point to your new stack. This will allow to tweak the infrastructure settings.

Deploy using the following commands:

```
npm install
cd apps/cdk
AWS_PROFILE=YOUR_PROFILE npm run cdk bootstrap
AWS_PROFILE=YOUR_PROFILE npm run cdk deploy
```

Setup the platform using:

```
